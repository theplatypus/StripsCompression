# StripsCompression

## Synopsis

Academic project to illustrate the topologic compression (lossless) principle.
Instead of describe a mesh triangle by triangle, common sides are aggregated in strips.
Despite its naive implementation, compression rate could reach up to 40% on simple meshes.

To illustrate those strips, a "toy web-interface" can vizualize this mesh-cutting, animating strips construction.
Strips animation uses WebGL, modules are written in javascript (ES5) so you only require a WebGL-friendly browser (Chrome, Opera, FF, ...) to launch a demo !

### Get the code

If you want to test it locally,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theplatypus/StripsCompression.git
cd ./StripsCompression
```

### HTTP Server

To access interface without file access issues, you need to serve it through a HTTP server.
There are many ways to do it, for example : 

```bash
# if node.js & npm are installed
npm install
npm test

# python 2.7
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# python 3.x
python -m http.server

# node.js & npm, general case
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 8000
```

### WebApp

Go to the following address with your WebGL-compatible browser

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/index.html
```

And you will get to the following toy application. (./DATA/cat.obj example)

This cat is a pretty good example, as we can see a long strip on its spine, and get a compression rate of 40%, which is quite good.

By default, stripes are drawed themselves, but you can stop it unchecking 'drawing' button, and see stripes construction step by step by increasing the footer counter.
